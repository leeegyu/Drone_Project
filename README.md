# Drone_Project

I'm working on a project to design a controller for drones.

All the codes have been written in the MATLAB 2024a environment.

The dynamics files represent the 6-dof dynamics of the aircraft, and in the main script files, 4-rk numerical integration is carried out using the dynamics.

Each file is managed according to its version.
